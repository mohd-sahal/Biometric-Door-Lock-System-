# ðŸ”’ Biometric-Door-Lock-System

A biometric-based electronic mini project that uses a phone's fingerprint sensor and Bluetooth to control a solenoid lock via an Arduino Uno. Built for enhanced access control in homes, offices, or labs.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Summary

This system integrates **biometric authentication** with **IoT-based hardware control**. A userâ€™s fingerprint is scanned using a phone fingerprint app and sent via **Bluetooth (HC-05)** to an **Arduino Uno**, which then activates a **5V relay** to unlock a **solenoid lock** if the fingerprint is valid.

### ðŸ”„ Workflow:

1. Fingerprint is scanned via a mobile app.
2. Bluetooth module HC-05 sends data to Arduino.
3. Arduino reads the input and checks if it matches a predefined value.
4. If matched:
   - Solenoid lock opens for 3 seconds.
